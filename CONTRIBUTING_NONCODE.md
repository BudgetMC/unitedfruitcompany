# Contributing for non-programmers

This is a guide for future students who wish to expand the site by adding posts. If you're a programmer and you want to work on the code, check out `CONTRIBUTING_CODE.md` instead.

## Adding posts

This website uses wordpress.com for managing posts and images, so adding stuff to the site is simple without needing to write code.

Dr. Reynolds will give you the login information to the Wordpress site. From there, visit the Posts section and start a new post.

### Categories

In order for the website to display your post, you need to add a category to it.

Valid categories are:

* Article
* Biographies
* Documents
* Photos
* Resources
* Timeline

If the post isn't categorized with something from that list, it won't show up on the site.

### Tags

You should also add tags with the notable people, places, and events mentioned in the post. This is especially important for images--there's no text to search so you have to rely on tags.

### Dates

Every post should have a date range attached. You enter this as a regular tag, but it needs to be a specific format.

The date range must be in exactly the XXXX-XXXX format to be detected as a date.

Valid date ranges are:

* 1855-1880
* 1880-1890
* 1890-1900
* 1900-1910
* 1910-1920
* 1920-1930
* 1930-1935
* 1935-1940
* 1940-1945

For documents, enter the date range that the document is from. For example, a newspaper article from 1936 would be tagged "1935-1940".

For articles, bios, etc., enter all date ranges that cover the time your figure was involved with the United Fruit Company.

Andrew Preston was a major figure in the company for many years, so he is in four different date ranges. Meanwhile, John Foster Dulles was a prominent figure for many years, but his relevance to the United Fruit Company only covers 1950-1955, so that's the only date tag he gets.

## Featured images

The site makes heavy used of Wordpress's "Featured Image" system.

### Categories that require a featured image

* Timeline posts **must** have a featured image, which shows up on the website's timeline page.
* Anything that's posted in the form of an image, like a photo or a document, should have the image set to featured image. Look at some document posts to see how they're set up.

### Categories that don't require a featured image

The biographical portraits in the bio pages are actually featured images. This is how featured images are handled for any type of text-based post. They're optional, but the posts look nicer with one.

## Conclusion

If that was a bit too much to take in, feel free to check out existing posts in the Wordpress site for examples.

If there's still any confusion, I should be around somewhere and hopefully not too busy to answer some questions.
