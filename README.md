# unitedfruitcompany.com

This is the frontend code for an upcoming educational site about the United Fruit Company.

The content of the site was created by the HIS 394 and HNR 331 combination class in Spring 2020, proctored by Dr. Jonathan T. Reynolds.

This frontend is developed by Camden Mecklem using Next.js and the Wordpress API.

## To-do

* used styled components instead of Next.js's crappy style system
